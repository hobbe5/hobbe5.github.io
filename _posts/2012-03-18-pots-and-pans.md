<p>Of all the projects I've been a part of, this is probably the proudest. Pots and Pans was created at a hackathon in Philly for local government looking to help with atrocities around the world. In Africa, villages in certain areas of the country are terrorized by pirates and mercenaries who harrass and steal from the people. After a raid, the citizens go into the streets banging pots and pans together to warn neighboring villages of the impending danger. We created a more modern service using old nokia cell phones.</p>

<p>As a team we were tasked with finding a way for people to be informed by a service within a specified radius. In our case we decided upon 50 kilometers but it can be changed in the settings of the admin portal as well. We then architected a service that allows users to send alerts to the service from a location and then have that message received to any subscribers within the specified radius. Our tech stack was using python and twilio to delivering the actual messages via text.</p>
